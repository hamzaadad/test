This project was build with react-script but edited for the sake of simplicity 
   libs used:
        React
        styled-components (ThemedStyledComponentsModule)

Happy reading;

i could've used react router to navigate from  main component to login to profil, but i made a login-box that has both states for the sake of animation.
i also started adding theming but was too lazy to complete the whole theme.
i used async await with fetch.
couldn't find user bio so i generated a gandome text when user is loaded.
couldn't find the font used in the mock-ups so i used googles font "Nunito Sans"

was planing to add some test but hey lets enjoy summer weekend

## How to run
